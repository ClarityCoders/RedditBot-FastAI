## Upload Data and Train your network. 
- I chose to upload all of my data to Google Drive and train VIA Google Colab.
- The file I trained with on Colab is Train_Colab.ipynb
- After training you can download your PKL file and add it to the project.

## Running the Bot.
- To run the bot you will need to install Pytorch.
- Make sure you have a 64 bit version of Python I would recomend 3.6 or above.
- Install the rest of the dependencies using...
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Then run reddit_Post.py and enter your reddit credentials.
